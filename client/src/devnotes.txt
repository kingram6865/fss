Login functionality

The "Activate Admin" flow should check the permissions status
If the permissions are not set for admin access, then the user
should be redirected to the login process.

Once the login process has completed successfully, there should be
a state carried through each screen and component indicating the
admin flag is active.

The active admin flag should trigger the admin version of components
So that add, update and delete functionality is enabled, until the admin
functionality is deliberately turnned off.

Also, a token should be held, so that once the login function is completed
the admin flag can be toggled without logging out.

Logging out completely should remove the access to the admin toggle, by removing
the login tokenn.
